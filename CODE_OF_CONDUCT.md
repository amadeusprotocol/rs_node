# Code of Conduct

We commit to a community where people can contribute productively and safely.

This project adopts the [**Contributor Covenant (v2.1)
**](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/)
as our Code of Conduct.

## Our Pledge

We pledge is to make participation a harassment‑free experience for everyone,
regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex
characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education,
socio‑economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy, compassion and kindness.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Harassment, trolling, or insults.
- Publishing others’ private information without permission.
- Sexualized language or imagery; sexual attention or advances.
- Sustained disruption of discussions.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards and
may remove or reject contributions not aligned with this Code, or
temporarily/permanently ban individuals for behavior they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual officially
represents the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Report violations to **vans@ama.one** and **valy@ama.one**. All reports will be
reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

1. **Correction** — private, written notice; impact: low.

2. **Warning** — clear warning with consequences; impact: medium.

3. **Temporary Ban** — a defined period of exclusion; impact: high.

4. **Permanent Ban** — removal from community participation; impact: severe.
